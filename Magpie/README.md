# AP4.Magpie

Lab for the Unit 4 AP CS-A class, with focus on string parsing. This project is organized in five activities, and the end of which you should have implemented a simple, rule-based chatbot. A conversation with your chatbot will look like below:
```
Hello, let's talk.
hey
Oh noooo! Really?
Yes, do you want to play with me?
What makes you think that I want to play with you?
I just hope I can play with you!
Why do you just hope I can play with me?
Because my brother said so.
Tell me more about your family.
Not now, I need to walk my dog.
Oh noooo! Really?
Yes, because I want him to be quiet.
Would you really be happy if you had him to be quiet?
Of course.
You don't say.
bye
Goodbye!
```
