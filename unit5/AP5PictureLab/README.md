# AP4.PictureLab

Lab assignment for the Unit 5 AP CS-A class. In this lab you will be writing methods that modify digital pictures. In writing these methods you will 
learn how to traverse a two-dimensional array of integers or objects. You will also be introduced to nested loops, binary numbers, interfaces, and inheritance.

This lab contains a significant number of supporting classes in the `src/main` folder. They implement a Graphical UserInterface (GUI) for displaying and manipulating digital images. However, there are only two files in which you will write code: `IntArrayWorker.java` and `Picture.java`. They include method prototypes annotated looking like below:

```
    /**
     * TODO: Activity 5, Exercise 4.
     * Method to negate the color of all pixels
     */
    public void negate() {
        throw new RuntimeException("Replace with your code for Activity 5, Exercise 4.");
    }
```

The code will be verified by means of unit tests, organized in 9 activities, and provided in the `src/tests` folder. Each activity test file (i.e. `A5_Tests.java`) contains a number of unit tests. They include knowledge checks on questions related to the project as well as assertions and validations on specific methods implemented in that activity.
