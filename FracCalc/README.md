# AP4.FracCalc

Lab for the Unit 4 AP CS-A class, with focus on arrays, string parsing and reference semantics. In this project you'll develop from scratch a fractional calculator. The program implements a command loop through which he user is evaluating expressions containing fractions like in the example below:
```
Welcome to FracCalc!
Expression?> 1_1/2 + 3_4/5
5_3/10
Expression?> 2 + 7/8
2_7/8
Expression?> quit
Goodbye!
```
This package includes an extensive set of tests, supporting the project development through several checkpoints.
