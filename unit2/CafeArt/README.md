# AP3.CafeArt

Lab for the Unit 3 AP CS-A class, with focus on for-loops, methods with parameters and return value:  

This project reproduces a "Cafe Art" design, by using a graphical user interface (GUI) library. The content needed for this lab:

- [ ] [CafeArt.docx](https://florinteo.github.io/EduLabs/ap3.CafeArt/spec/CafeArt.docx): complete specification of the project.
- [ ] [drawing-lib](https://florinteo.github.io/EduLabs/ap3.Equestria/lib/drawing-lib-2.0-shaded.jar): Java API library supporting graphic operations such as composing and displaying the cafe art on the screen. Also available in the assignment package, in the _lib_ folder. Instructions of how to configure this library in your environment can be found [here](https://github.com/LWHSStave/Setup/blob/main/RefJar/README.md).
- [ ] [CafeWall](https://florinteo.github.io/EduCode/DrawingLib/edu/ftdev/CafeArt/CafeWall.html) class: detailed documentation of the class contained in the `drawing-lib` library, the only one needed for this project.
- [ ] [CafeArt.java](https://florinteo.github.io/EduLabs/ap3.CafeArt/src/CafeArt.java) startup code: showcases the usage of the CafeWall GUI API. Also available in the assignement package, in the _src_ folder. Project should be build within this file.
